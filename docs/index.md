This is the final file from the "Doc Sharding" task. Your `docs` directory is now fully populated with a well-organized knowledge base.

My work as the Product Owner in preparing the documentation is now complete. The next step is to prepare the very first task for the developer agent. This is typically handled by the **Scrum Master (SM) agent, Bob**. His job is to take all this context and create a detailed, self-contained story file for the developer to execute.

Would you like me to hand over to the Scrum Master to prepare Story 1.1 for development?
