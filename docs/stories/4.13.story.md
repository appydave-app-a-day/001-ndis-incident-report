# Story 4.13: Enhanced Consolidation UX & Controls

## Epic
Epic 4: Guided Incident Capture Workflow

## Description
Improve the user experience around narrative consolidation by fixing phase alignment issues, implementing a clear modal dialog for processing feedback, and adding dynamic mock/live mode switching. These foundational UX improvements will enhance user understanding of the AI consolidation process and provide better control over API integration modes.

## User Story
As a frontline worker, I want clear feedback about which narrative phase is being enhanced with a prominent processing dialog, and I want the ability to switch between mock and live API modes, so I can better understand what's happening and have control over the enhancement process.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Fix Phase Alignment Bug
- **Problem**: All four clarification steps (Before Event, During Event, End Event, Post-Event) show incorrect consolidation messages when pressing "Next"
- **Current Behavior**: Step shows "enhancing next event" instead of current event being processed
- **Expected Behavior**: When leaving a step, the consolidation message should clearly indicate the current phase being enhanced
- **Examples**:
  - Leaving "Before Event Clarification" → "Enhancing Before Event narrative..."
  - Leaving "During Event Clarification" → "Enhancing During Event narrative..."
  - Leaving "End Event Clarification" → "Enhancing End Event narrative..."
  - Leaving "Post-Event Support Clarification" → "Enhancing Post-Event Support narrative..."

### 2. Modal Dialog for Consolidation Process
- **Replace Small Spinner**: Remove the current small spinner at bottom of pages
- **Modal Implementation**: Show a modal dialog during consolidation with:
  - Clear title: "Enhancing Narrative"
  - Phase-specific message: "Enhancing [Phase Name] narrative with AI assistance..."
  - Prominent, centered spinner with appropriate size
  - Modal blocks user interaction during processing
  - Auto-closes when consolidation completes successfully
  - Automatically advances to next wizard step after closing
- **Error Handling**: If consolidation fails:
  - Modal shows error state with retry button
  - User can dismiss modal to continue without enhancement
  - Error state preserves original narrative content

### 3. Dynamic Mock/Live Mode Toggle
- **Header Icon**: Add toggle icon in wizard header next to existing "View Content" and "Populate Test Data" icons
- **Visual Design**: 
  - Icon clearly indicates current mode (Mock/Live)
  - Clicking toggles between modes
  - Visual feedback shows which mode is active
- **Functionality**:
  - Overrides environment variable setting (VITE_API_MODE)
  - Persists user choice for current browser session
  - Applies to all API calls (consolidation, clarification questions)
  - Default to environment variable on first load
- **User Experience**:
  - Tooltip shows current mode and click action
  - Immediate visual feedback when toggling
  - No page refresh required

### 4. Integration Requirements
- **Wizard Framework**: Modal integrates cleanly with existing wizard navigation
- **State Management**: Mode toggle integrates with existing API service layer
- **Error Boundaries**: Consolidation errors don't break wizard flow
- **Responsive Design**: Modal and toggle work on mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: Modal has proper focus management and keyboard navigation

## Technical Requirements

### Phase Alignment Fix
```typescript
// Current issue: useStepConsolidation hook may be mapping phases incorrectly
const STEP_TO_PHASE_MAPPING = {
  'before-clarification': 'beforeEvent',
  'during-clarification': 'duringEvent', 
  'end-clarification': 'endEvent',
  'post-clarification': 'postEvent'
};

// Ensure consolidation triggers for correct phase when leaving each step
```

### Modal Dialog Component
```typescript
interface ConsolidationModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  phase: 'beforeEvent' | 'duringEvent' | 'endEvent' | 'postEvent';
  isLoading: boolean;
  error?: string;
  onRetry: () => void;
  onDismiss: () => void;
}

const PHASE_LABELS = {
  beforeEvent: 'Before Event',
  duringEvent: 'During Event', 
  endEvent: 'End Event',
  postEvent: 'Post-Event Support'
};
```

### API Mode Toggle
```typescript
interface ApiModeToggleProps {
  className?: string;
}

// Store mode in sessionStorage or Zustand store
type ApiMode = 'mock' | 'live';

// Update API service to check user preference over environment
const getApiMode = (): ApiMode => {
  // Check user preference first, fallback to environment
  return userPreference || import.meta.env.VITE_API_MODE || 'mock';
};
```

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Fix Phase Alignment Bug
- **Audit Current Implementation**: Review `useStepConsolidation.ts` and clarification step components
- **Correct Phase Mapping**: Ensure each step consolidates the correct phase
- **Update Step Components**: Verify all four clarification steps trigger correct consolidation
- **Test Consolidation Messages**: Confirm messages show correct phase being enhanced

### 2. Create Consolidation Modal
- **Modal Component**: Create `ConsolidationModal.tsx` with loading, success, and error states
- **Integration**: Replace existing small spinner with modal calls
- **State Management**: Add modal state to consolidation store or wizard store
- **Navigation Control**: Ensure modal auto-advances wizard on success
- **Error Handling**: Implement retry functionality and graceful failure modes

### 3. Implement API Mode Toggle  
- **Toggle Component**: Create `ApiModeToggle.tsx` for wizard header
- **State Management**: Add API mode preference to store
- **API Service Update**: Modify service layer to respect user preference
- **Visual Design**: Create clear icons/indicators for mock vs live mode
- **Session Persistence**: Store user preference across browser session

### 4. Update Existing Components
- **Wizard Header**: Add API mode toggle to header layout
- **Clarification Steps**: Remove existing small spinners, integrate modal
- **Store Updates**: Extend stores to support modal state and API mode preference
- **Hook Updates**: Modify consolidation hooks to use modal instead of inline status

### 5. Testing & Validation
- **Phase Testing**: Test all four clarification steps for correct consolidation
- **Modal Flow**: Test complete modal workflow including errors and retries
- **Mode Switching**: Test toggle between mock and live modes
- **Navigation**: Verify wizard navigation works correctly with modal integration

## Error Handling Strategy

### Consolidation Failures
1. **Modal Error State**: Show error message with retry option
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Allow user to continue without enhancement
3. **Preserve Data**: Original narratives always preserved
4. **Clear Messaging**: Explain what happened and user options

### API Mode Issues
1. **Network Failures**: Handle live mode network errors gracefully
2. **Invalid Responses**: Validate API responses and fallback appropriately  
3. **Mode Switching**: Handle mode changes during active requests

## User Experience Goals

### Clarity and Transparency
- **Clear Processing Feedback**: Users understand exactly what's happening during consolidation
- **Phase Accuracy**: No confusion about which phase is being enhanced
- **Control**: Users can choose between mock and live enhancement modes

### Professional Feel
- **Smooth Interactions**: Modal provides polished experience during processing
- **Error Recovery**: Failures don't disrupt workflow
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Features work even if consolidation fails

## Files Requiring Changes

### New Components
- `src/components/ui/ConsolidationModal.tsx` - Modal dialog for consolidation process
- `src/components/ui/ApiModeToggle.tsx` - Toggle between mock/live modes

### Modified Components
- `src/hooks/useStepConsolidation.ts` - Fix phase alignment and add modal integration
- `src/components/wizard/WizardHeader.tsx` - Add API mode toggle to header
- `src/store/useIncidentStore.ts` - Add modal state and API mode preference
- `src/lib/services/api.ts` - Respect user API mode preference
- All clarification step components - Remove small spinners, integrate modal

### Updated Imports
- Add modal and toggle components to relevant parent components
- Update wizard header layout to include new toggle
- Modify consolidation hooks to use modal system

## Design Principles

### Modal Design
- **Prominent but Not Intrusive**: Clear but doesn't overwhelm UI
- **Informative**: Shows exactly what's happening and why
- **Controllable**: User can dismiss on error, automatic on success

### Toggle Design  
- **Discoverable**: Clear icon placement in header
- **Understandable**: Obvious what current mode is and what clicking does
- **Consistent**: Matches existing header icon styling

### Error Handling
- **Graceful**: Errors don't break user flow
- **Informative**: Clear explanation of what went wrong
- **Recoverable**: Always provide path forward

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Sonnet 4`

### Implementation Plan
This story addresses three critical UX improvements that will enhance the consolidation experience:

1. **Accuracy**: Fix phase alignment so users see correct consolidation messages
2. **Clarity**: Replace small spinners with prominent modal dialog showing exactly what's happening  
3. **Control**: Give users ability to switch between mock and live API modes dynamically

These improvements create a foundation for better user experience and will make the subsequent "Add Question" feature (Story 4.14) more intuitive since users will have clearer understanding of the processing workflow.

### Change Log
- Will be updated during implementation
