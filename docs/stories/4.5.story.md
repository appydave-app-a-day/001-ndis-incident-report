# Story 4.5: Implement "End of Event" Clarification Step

## Epic
Epic 4: Guided Incident Capture Workflow

## Description
Implement the fifth step of the "Incident Capture" wizard featuring a clarification interface for the "End of the Event" narrative phase. This step presents pre-fetched clarifying questions specifically related to the user's "End of the Event" narrative input, allowing frontline workers to provide additional context and details through optional answers. The interface maintains complete consistency with the previous clarification steps while focusing on questions relevant to how the incident concluded.

## User Story
As a frontline worker, I want to move to a new step to answer clarifying questions specifically about the "End of the Event" narrative.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The fifth step of the "Incident Capture" wizard is dedicated to "End of Event" clarifications
2. The system displays the list of pre-fetched questions that are relevant to the "End of the Event" phase from the clarification questions store
3. Each question is displayed on the screen with clear, readable formatting and paired with its own multi-line text input field for the answer
4. Questions are presented in a logical, easy-to-scan layout with proper spacing and visual hierarchy consistent with previous clarification steps
5. The user can navigate to the next step without entering text into any of the answer fields (i.e., answering is optional)
6. Any answers provided are captured and stored in the application's state, associated with their respective questions in the "end" phase
7. The step includes proper loading states if questions are still being fetched
8. Error handling displays appropriate messaging if no questions are available for the "End of Event" phase
9. Form styling matches the existing design system and is fully responsive
10. Navigation validation allows proceeding regardless of whether answers are provided (optional completion)

## Technical Requirements
- Create an EndOfEventClarificationStep component as the fifth step in the IncidentCapture wizard
- Reuse existing clarification answer infrastructure from the IncidentStore (no additional store changes needed)
- Use shadcn/ui Textarea components for answer input fields with consistent styling
- Follow the same component patterns established in BeforeEventClarificationStep and DuringEventClarificationStep for consistency
- Integrate with the existing wizard framework and navigation system
- Handle cases where clarification questions may not be loaded yet
- Ensure responsive design across mobile and desktop devices
- Maintain state persistence when navigating between wizard steps

## Implementation Notes
- Follow the exact same patterns as BeforeEventClarificationStep and DuringEventClarificationStep but target the "end" phase questions
- Use the existing StepHeader component for the step title and description
- Questions should be displayed in the order they were fetched from the API
- Text areas should be appropriately sized for detailed responses (similar to other steps)
- Store answers using the updateClarificationAnswer function with phase set to "end"
- Implement the same three UI states: loading, no questions, and questions display
- Follow existing form styling patterns with proper labels and spacing
- Maintain the same helpful messaging and user guidance patterns
- Ensure complete visual and functional consistency with previous clarification steps

## Dependencies
- Epic 2 (Core Wizard & Navigation Framework) must be completed
- Epic 3 Story 3.1 (Wizard Styling) must be completed  
- Story 4.1 (Metadata Input Step) must be completed
- Story 4.2 (Multi-Section Narrative Input Step & Pre-fetch Clarifications) must be completed
- Story 4.3 (Before Event Clarification Step) must be completed
- Story 4.4 (During Event Clarification Step) must be completed
- Clarification questions must be available in the incident store from Step 2
- shadcn/ui Textarea and Label components must be available

- [x] Code passes ESLint and TypeScript checks
- [x] Manual testing completed for question display, answer persistence, and navigation
- [x] Cross-browser and mobile testing completed
- [x] Edge cases tested (no questions, loading states, navigation behavior)
- [x] Consistency verified with BeforeEventClarificationStep and DuringEventClarificationStep implementations

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Claude Sonnet 4`

### Completion Notes List
- Created EndOfEventClarificationStep component following exact patterns from BeforeEventClarificationStep and DuringEventClarificationStep
- Implemented identical three-state interface: loading, no questions available, and questions display
- Questions are displayed from the "end" phase of pre-fetched clarification questions store
- Each question paired with appropriately sized multi-line text area for detailed responses
- Real-time state updates as users type answers, with immediate persistence using updateClarificationAnswer
- Answers are completely optional - users can proceed without completing any questions
- Loading state shows spinner with descriptive message during question fetching
- No questions state provides helpful guidance with option to proceed
- Integrated component as Step 5 in wizard with updated step titles and navigation structure
- Review step shifted to Step 6 to accommodate new clarification step
- Component maintains complete consistency with previous clarification step design and functionality
- Fully responsive layout works across mobile and desktop devices
- Proper error handling for edge cases and graceful degradation
- Reuses existing clarification answer infrastructure without requiring additional store changes

### Change Log
- Added `src/components/EndOfEventClarificationStep.tsx` - New clarification step component for "end" phase questions
- Modified `src/routes/IncidentCapture.tsx` - Integrated EndOfEventClarificationStep as Step 5, shifted review to Step 6, updated step structure and navigation titles
