# Story 1.1: Initial Application Scaffolding

## Status: Review

## Story

- As a developer
- I want to create the initial React application using a standard scaffolding tool (e.g., Vite)
- so that we have a basic, runnable starting point for the project.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  A new React project is successfully created in the project's monorepo.
2.  Running the standard `dev` command (e.g., `npm run dev`) successfully starts the local development server without errors.
3.  The default application starter page is accessible and renders correctly in a web browser.
4.  The initial project files are successfully committed to the main branch of the version control system.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Create a new React project using Vite and TypeScript. (AC: 1)
  - [x] Use `npm create vite@latest` to initiate the project.
  - [x] Select `React` as the framework and `TypeScript` as the variant.
  - [x] Name the project based on the overall project structure, i.e., `.` to create the React app at the root of the current workspace directory.
- [x] Task 2: Verify the development server starts successfully. (AC: 2)
  - [x] Install dependencies within the new project: `npm install`.
  - [x] Run the development server: `npm run dev`.
  - [x] Confirm no errors are reported in the console.
- [x] Task 3: Verify the default application page renders in a web browser. (AC: 3)
  - [x] Open the URL provided by the `npm run dev` command (typically `http://localhost:5173/` or similar).
  - [x] Visually confirm the default Vite + React starter page loads correctly.
- [x] Task 4: Commit the initial project files to version control. (AC: 4)
  - [x] Add all newly created project files to git.
  - [x] Create an initial commit with a clear message (e.g., "feat: Initial Vite React TypeScript project setup").

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Framework & Build Tool:** Use `Vite` as per `docs/tech-stack.md`.
- **Language:** Use `TypeScript` for the project.
- **Project Structure:** The new React project should be scaffolded at the root of the current repository (`/Users/davidcruwys/dev/ad/appydave/appydave-app-a-day/001-ndis-incident-report`). This implies the `src/` directory and other Vite-generated files will be directly in this root.

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20:thinking`

### Completion Notes List

- Project creation location is at the current workspace root.

### Change Log

## Story Completion Summary

This story successfully established the initial React application scaffolding using Vite as the build tool. The project was created with TypeScript support at the repository root, configured with modern development tools including React 18, Tailwind CSS for styling, ESLint for code quality, and proper TypeScript configuration. The development server runs successfully on port 5173, the default Vite+React page renders correctly, and all initial project files have been committed to version control. Additionally, the project was initialized as a git repository and connected to the remote GitHub repository at `git@github.com:appydave-app-a-day/001-ndis-incident-report.git`.
