# Story 1.1: Initial Application Scaffolding

## Status: Approved

## Story

- As a developer
- I want to create the initial React application using a standard scaffolding tool (e.g., Vite)
- so that we have a basic, runnable starting point for the project.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  A new React project is successfully created in the project's monorepo.
2.  Running the standard `dev` command (e.g., `npm run dev`) successfully starts the local development server without errors.
3.  The default application starter page is accessible and renders correctly in a web browser.
4.  The initial project files are successfully committed to the main branch of the version control system.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Create a new React project using Vite and TypeScript. (AC: 1)
    - [ ] Use `npm create vite@latest` to initiate the project.
    - [ ] Select `React` as the framework and `TypeScript` as the variant.
    - [ ] Name the project based on the overall project structure, i.e., `.` to create the React app at the root of the current workspace directory.
- [ ] Task 2: Verify the development server starts successfully. (AC: 2)
    - [ ] Install dependencies within the new project: `npm install`.
    - [ ] Run the development server: `npm run dev`.
    - [ ] Confirm no errors are reported in the console.
- [ ] Task 3: Verify the default application page renders in a web browser. (AC: 3)
    - [ ] Open the URL provided by the `npm run dev` command (typically `http://localhost:5173/` or similar).
    - [ ] Visually confirm the default Vite + React starter page loads correctly.
- [ ] Task 4: Commit the initial project files to version control. (AC: 4)
    - [ ] Add all newly created project files to git.
    - [ ] Create an initial commit with a clear message (e.g., "feat: Initial Vite React TypeScript project setup").

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Framework & Build Tool:** Use `Vite` as per `docs/tech-stack.md`.
- **Language:** Use `TypeScript` for the project.
- **Project Structure:** The new React project should be scaffolded at the root of the current repository (`/Users/davidcruwys/dev/ad/appydave/appydave-app-a-day/001-ndis-incident-report`). This implies the `src/` directory and other Vite-generated files will be directly in this root.
