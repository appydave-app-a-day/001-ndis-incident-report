# Story 4.8: Enhance Test Data with Clarification Answers

## Epic
Epic 4: Guided Incident Capture Workflow

## Description
Enhance the existing test data pre-population button (Story 4.7) with progressive data population capabilities. Add a second level of test data that includes realistic clarification answers for all 12 mock clarification questions (3 per phase), allowing testers and developers to efficiently test the complete incident capture workflow including the clarification steps. The button will now support multi-level population: first click populates basic data, second click adds clarification data, third click resets.

## User Story
As a developer/tester, I want the test data button to support progressive population so I can efficiently test both the basic incident capture workflow and the complete clarification workflow without manually entering dozens of form fields.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The existing test data button supports progressive population with visual feedback
2. First click populates the 8 basic fields (metadata + narrative) as currently implemented
3. Second click loads mock clarification questions and populates all 12 clarification answers with realistic responses
4. Third click resets all data to empty state for fresh testing
5. Button tooltip or visual indicator shows current test data level
6. Clarification answers are contextually appropriate and extend the David/Lisa incident scenario
7. Mock clarification questions are properly loaded into the store when populating answers
8. All clarification answer fields display the populated data correctly across all clarification steps
9. Progressive population works seamlessly with existing state management
10. Button functionality maintains the subtle design and positioning from Story 4.7

## Technical Requirements
- Extend the existing `populateTestData` function with multi-level logic
- Add test data level tracking to the incident store (`'none' | 'basic' | 'full'`)
- Create realistic test data for all 12 clarification questions from mock data
- Ensure clarification questions are loaded when populating answers
- Use existing `updateClarificationAnswer` and `setClarificationQuestions` store methods
- Maintain backwards compatibility with existing test data functionality
- Preserve existing button styling and positioning from Story 4.7
- Add appropriate visual feedback for current population level

## Test Data Specification - Clarification Answers
The following realistic answers should extend the David/Lisa pizza delivery incident scenario:

**Before Event Clarifications:**
- b1 (Participant activity): "Lisa was sitting quietly on the couch, watching afternoon television and appeared relaxed"
- b2 (Green eggs): "No, she prefers regular eggs"
- b3 (Environment): "The living room was calm and quiet, with normal lighting and no other people present"

**During Event Clarifications:**
- d1 (Duration): "The incident lasted approximately 15-20 minutes from start to finish"
- d2 (Witnesses): "Only the pizza delivery person at the door and myself as the support worker were present"
- d3 (Interventions): "I attempted verbal de-escalation and tried to explain who was at the door, but Lisa was too agitated to listen"

**End Event Clarifications:**
- e1 (Resolution): "Police officers were able to calm Lisa down using verbal de-escalation techniques and safely removed the knife"
- e2 (Injuries): "No one was physically injured during the incident, though Lisa was emotionally distressed"
- e3 (Outcome): "Lisa was taken to the local psychiatric hospital for assessment and stabilization"

**Post Event Clarifications:**
- p1 (Follow-up): "Contact was made with Lisa's case manager and family, incident was documented, and debriefing was conducted"
- p2 (Supervisor): "Yes, the on-call supervisor was immediately notified and arrived on-site within 30 minutes"
- p3 (Support): "Lisa received immediate psychiatric assessment and overnight monitoring before returning home the next day"

## Implementation Notes
- Track test data level in store to determine button behavior
- First click: Populate basic metadata and narrative (existing behavior)
- Second click: Load mock questions + populate all clarification answers
- Third click: Reset all data to initial state
- Update button tooltip to reflect current state ("Populate basic data" / "Add clarification answers" / "Reset data")
- Ensure progressive population works from any wizard step
- Maintain existing form state synchronization to prevent infinite loops
- Use existing mock clarification questions from `api.ts`
- Test data should be immediately visible in form fields across all steps

## Dependencies
- Epic 2 (Core Wizard & Navigation Framework) must be completed
- Epic 3 Story 3.1 (Wizard Styling) must be completed  
- Story 4.1 through 4.6 (All clarification steps) must be completed
- Story 4.7 (Test Data Pre-Population Button) must be completed
- Mock clarification questions must be available in `src/lib/services/api.ts`
- Existing form state synchronization must be working correctly

- [x] Progressive population works from any wizard step
- [x] Button maintains existing subtle design and positioning
- [x] Code passes ESLint and TypeScript checks
- [x] Manual testing completed across all wizard steps and population levels
- [x] Cross-browser testing completed
- [x] State management integration works seamlessly
- [x] No infinite loops or performance issues
