# Story 4.12: Implement Enhanced Review and Complete Step

## Epic
Epic 4: Guided Incident Capture Workflow

## Description
Transform the current placeholder Step 7 into a comprehensive review screen that displays all collected incident data, including metadata, original narratives, AI-enhanced supplementary narratives, and consolidation status. This provides frontline workers with a complete overview of their incident report before final submission, showcasing the results of the progressive narrative consolidation implemented in Story 4.11.

## User Story
As a frontline worker, I want a comprehensive review screen that shows all my incident data including the AI-enhanced narratives, so I can review the complete report before submitting and see how my original information has been professionally enhanced.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Complete Data Display**: The review screen displays all collected incident information in a clear, organized format
2. **Metadata Section**: Shows reporter name, participant name, event date/time, and location
3. **Enhanced Narratives Showcase**: Prominently displays the AI-consolidated supplementary narratives for each phase
4. **Professional Layout**: Information is presented in a clear, easy-to-read format suitable for review
5. **Consolidation Status**: Shows which phases were successfully enhanced and any error states
6. **Complete Button**: A "Complete" button finalizes the incident capture process
7. **Original Narratives Access**: Option to view original user-entered narratives alongside enhanced versions
8. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles cases where some consolidations failed or are in progress
9. **Navigation Update**: Upon completion, marks the "Incident Capture" workflow as finished
10. **Responsive Design**: Review screen works well on different screen sizes

## Technical Requirements

### Data Sources
```typescript
// From useIncidentStore
const {
  report: {
    metadata,           // Basic incident information
    narrative,          // Original user-entered narratives  
    narrativeExtras     // AI-enhanced supplementary narratives
  },
  consolidationStatus,  // Status of each phase's consolidation
  consolidationErrors   // Any errors that occurred during consolidation
} = useIncidentStore();
```

### Component Architecture
```typescript
interface IncidentReviewStepProps {
  // No props needed - reads from store
}

interface ReviewSectionProps {
  title: string;
  children: React.ReactNode;
  className?: string;
}

interface NarrativeDisplayProps {
  phase: 'beforeEvent' | 'duringEvent' | 'endEvent' | 'postEvent';
  phaseLabel: string;
  originalNarrative: string;
  enhancedNarrative: string;
  consolidationStatus: ConsolidationStatus[keyof ConsolidationStatus];
  error?: string;
}
```

## Review Screen Layout Design

### Header Section
```
üìã Step 7: Review & Complete
Review your complete incident report before submission
```

### Metadata Summary
```
Incident Details
Reporter: David
Participant: Lisa  
Date & Time: 2024-01-15 14:30
Location: Mascot Community Center
```

### Enhanced Narratives (Primary Focus)
```
‚ú® Professional Incident Report

Before Event ‚úì Enhanced
[AI-enhanced narrative with option to view original]

During Event ‚úì Enhanced  
[AI-enhanced narrative with option to view original]

End Event ‚úì Enhanced
[AI-enhanced narrative with option to view original]

Post Event ‚úì Enhanced
[AI-enhanced narrative with option to view original]
```

### Completion Actions
```
üìä Enhancement Summary: 4 of 4 phases successfully enhanced

```

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Replace Placeholder Step 7
- Remove current placeholder Step7 component from `IncidentCapture.tsx`
- Create comprehensive `IncidentReviewStep` component
- Integrate with existing wizard framework

### 2. Create Core Review Components
- `IncidentReviewStep` - Main review component
- `MetadataDisplay` - Clean metadata presentation  
- `EnhancedNarrativeDisplay` - Showcase AI-enhanced narratives
- `ConsolidationSummary` - Overall enhancement status

### 3. Enhanced Narratives Showcase
- Display AI-consolidated narratives prominently for each phase
- Show consolidation status indicators (‚úì Enhanced, ‚ö†Ô∏è Failed, üîÑ In Progress)
- Provide option to view original narratives in collapsible sections
- Handle cases where consolidation failed or is still in progress

### 4. Professional Visual Design
- Use existing Card, Label, and typography components
- Clean visual hierarchy with proper spacing
- Green/success styling for enhanced content
- Yellow/warning styling for fallback content
- Status badges for consolidation state

### 5. Completion Workflow
- "Complete Report" button to finalize submission
- Success feedback upon completion
- Console logging for MVP (can be enhanced later for real submission)
- Wizard completion handling

### 6. Error State Management
- Display consolidation failures gracefully
- Show partial completion states (e.g., "3 of 4 phases enhanced")
- Fall back to original narratives when enhancement unavailable
- Clear status messaging for users

## Example Component Structure

```typescript
const EnhancedNarrativeDisplay: React.FC<NarrativeDisplayProps> = ({
  phase,
  phaseLabel,
  originalNarrative,
  enhancedNarrative,
  consolidationStatus,
  error
}) => {
  const [showOriginal, setShowOriginal] = useState(false);

  if (consolidationStatus === 'complete' && enhancedNarrative) {
    return (
      <Card className="mb-4">
        <CardHeader>
          <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">{phaseLabel}</h3>
            <div className="flex items-center text-green-600">
              <CheckCircle2 className="h-4 w-4 mr-1" />
              <span className="text-sm">Enhanced</span>
            </div>
          </div>
        </CardHeader>
        <CardContent>
          <div className="bg-green-50 border border-green-200 rounded-lg p-4">
            <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">{enhancedNarrative}</p>
          </div>
          <Button
            variant="ghost"
            size="sm"
            onClick={() => setShowOriginal(!showOriginal)}
            className="mt-2 text-sm"
          >
            {showOriginal ? 'Hide' : 'View'} Original Narrative
          </Button>
          {showOriginal && (
            <div className="mt-2 p-3 bg-gray-50 border rounded">
              <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">{originalNarrative}</p>
            </div>
          )}
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
    );
  }

  // Fallback for failed/pending consolidation
  return (
    <Card className="mb-4">
      <CardHeader>
        <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">{phaseLabel}</h3>
          <ConsolidationStatusBadge status={consolidationStatus} error={error} />
        </div>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <div className="bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-lg p-4">
          <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">{originalNarrative}</p>
        </div>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
};
```
