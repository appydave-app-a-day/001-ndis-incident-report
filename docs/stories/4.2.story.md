# Story 4.2: Implement Multi-Section Narrative Input Step & Pre-fetch Clarifications

## Epic
Epic 4: Guided Incident Capture Workflow

## Description
Implement the second step of the "Incident Capture" wizard featuring a comprehensive narrative input screen with four distinct text areas for capturing detailed incident descriptions. This step allows frontline workers to provide complete context across all phases of an incident: Before, During, End, and Post-Event. Upon completion of this step, the system will asynchronously pre-fetch clarifying questions for all narrative sections to streamline the subsequent clarification workflow.

## User Story
As a frontline worker, I want a single screen with four separate text areas to capture my entire narrative for the "Before," "During," "End," and "Post-Event" phases of the incident so I can provide all context in one go.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The second step of the "Incident Capture" wizard displays a single screen/view with a comprehensive narrative input interface
2. The screen contains four distinct and clearly labeled multi-line text areas:
   - "Before the Event" - for capturing context leading up to the incident
   - "During the Event" - for describing what happened during the incident
   - "End of the Event" - for documenting how the incident concluded
   - "Post-Event Support" - for recording any follow-up actions taken
3. Each text area is appropriately sized (minimum 4-6 rows) to encourage detailed input from users
4. Text areas include placeholder text to guide users on what information to include
5. The text entered into each of the four fields is captured and stored separately in the application's state using the existing incident store
6. Upon the user clicking "Next" to leave this step, the application triggers a single asynchronous request to retrieve clarifying questions for all four narrative sections simultaneously
7. A loading state is displayed while questions are being fetched to provide user feedback
8. Error handling is implemented for failed API requests with appropriate user messaging
9. Form validation ensures at least one narrative section has content before allowing navigation
10. The step integrates seamlessly with the existing wizard navigation system

## Technical Requirements
- Extend the existing IncidentStore (useIncidentStore.ts) to include narrative data structure
- Create a NarrativeInputStep component as the second step in the IncidentCapture wizard
- Use shadcn/ui Textarea components for consistent styling and functionality
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for narrative data and API responses
- Integrate with the N8N API service layer for fetching clarification questions
- Add loading states and error handling using established patterns
- Ensure the step validation works with the existing wizard framework
- Store narrative data in the incident store's narrative section
- Pre-fetch clarification questions and store them for use in subsequent steps

## Implementation Notes
- Follow existing code patterns established in MetadataInputStep for consistency
- Use the established Tailwind CSS classes and design system for styling
- Ensure responsive design works across mobile and desktop devices
- Implement proper accessibility with labels, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation
- Consider UX patterns for large text areas (auto-resize, character counts if needed)
- Use the existing API service layer pattern for the question fetching functionality
- Store fetched questions in the incident store for use by clarification steps
- Handle API errors gracefully with user-friendly messaging

## Dependencies
- Epic 2 (Core Wizard & Navigation Framework) must be completed
- Epic 3 Story 3.1 (Wizard Styling) must be completed
- Story 4.1 (Metadata Input Step) must be completed
- N8N API service layer must be available for question fetching
- shadcn/ui Textarea components must be available

## API Integration
- **Endpoint**: N8N workflow for "Get Clarifying Questions"
- **Method**: POST
- **Request Body**: Contains the four narrative sections
- **Response**: Returns clarifying questions categorized by narrative phase
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if API is unavailable (allow proceeding without questions)

## Definition of Done
- [x] IncidentStore extended to support narrative data structure with TypeScript interfaces
- [x] NarrativeInputStep component created with four properly labeled text areas
- [x] Component integrated as Step 2 of the Incident Capture wizard
- [x] User input properly stored in application state for all four narrative sections
- [x] Text areas provide good user experience with appropriate sizing and placeholder text
- [x] Form validation prevents navigation without at least one completed narrative section
- [x] API integration implemented to pre-fetch clarifying questions on step completion
- [x] Loading states and error handling implemented for API requests
- [x] Component styling matches existing design system and is responsive
- [x] Step validation integrates correctly with wizard navigation framework
- [x] TypeScript types are properly defined and used throughout
- [x] Code passes ESLint and TypeScript checks
- [x] Manual testing completed for form functionality, state persistence, and API integration
- [x] Error scenarios tested (API failures, network issues)
- [x] Cross-browser and mobile testing completed
- [x] Scrolling issues resolved for proper mobile and desktop usability
- [x] UI optimizations implemented (removed redundant headers and icons for space efficiency)

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Claude Sonnet 4`
