# Story 1.2: Install Core Dependencies

## Status: Complete

## Story

- As a developer
- I want to install and configure the core project dependencies, including the chosen UI library (e.g., Tailwind CSS or shadcn/ui)
- so that foundational tools are available for all subsequent development

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The chosen UI library (e.g., Tailwind CSS or shadcn/ui) is successfully installed.
2. The necessary configuration files for the UI library (e.g., `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`) are created and correctly configured.
3. The application's main stylesheet is updated to include the necessary directives for the UI library.
4. The application successfully compiles and runs with the new dependencies installed.
5. All changes, including updates to `package.json` (and lock files) and new configuration files, are committed to version control.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Analyze current project setup (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)

  - [x] Review the existing `package.json` to understand already installed dependencies
  - [x] Verify Tailwind CSS installation status (already installed in story 1.1)
  - [x] Check for existing configuration files (`tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`)
  - [x] Examine `src/index.css` for Tailwind directives

- [x] Task 2: Install and configure shadcn/ui components (AC: 1, 2, 4)

  - [x] Initialize shadcn/ui using the CLI: `npx shadcn@latest init`
  - [x] Select the following options during initialization:
    - TypeScript: Yes
    - Style: Default
    - Base color: Neutral
    - CSS variables: Yes
  - [x] Verify `components.json` is created with proper configuration
  - [x] Ensure the `src/components/ui/` directory is created
  - [x] Verify path alias configuration in `tsconfig.json` for `@/` imports

- [x] Task 3: Install core UI components from shadcn/ui (AC: 1, 4)

  - [x] Install essential components for the wizard framework:
    - `npx shadcn@latest add button`
    - `npx shadcn@latest add card`
    - `npx shadcn@latest add input`
    - `npx shadcn@latest add label`
    - `npx shadcn@latest add textarea`
    - `npx shadcn@latest add progress`
  - [x] Verify components are properly installed in `src/components/ui/`

- [x] Task 4: Install additional project dependencies (AC: 1, 4)

  - [x] Install Zustand for state management: `npm install zustand`
  - [x] Install React Router for routing: `npm install react-router-dom`
  - [x] Install React Hook Form for form management: `npm install react-hook-form`
  - [x] Install date-fns for date handling: `npm install date-fns`
  - [x] Install clsx and tailwind-merge utilities (if not already installed by shadcn/ui)

- [x] Task 5: Configure global styles and CSS variables (AC: 3)

  - [x] Update `src/index.css` to include CSS variables for theming
  - [x] Ensure Tailwind directives are properly configured
  - [x] Add any necessary global styles for the application

- [x] Task 6: Verify build and development server (AC: 4)

  - [x] Run `npm run dev` to ensure the development server starts without errors
  - [x] Run `npm run build` to verify production build works
  - [x] Run `npm run lint` to ensure no linting errors are introduced
  - [x] Test that the application renders correctly with new dependencies

- [x] Task 7: Update project documentation and commit changes (AC: 5)
  - [x] Update any relevant documentation about the installed dependencies
  - [x] Stage all changes including:
    - Updated `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
    - New configuration files (`components.json`)
    - New UI components in `src/components/ui/`
    - Updated `src/index.css`
  - [x] Create a commit with message: "feat: Install and configure core dependencies including shadcn/ui, Zustand, React Router, and React Hook Form"

## Dev Technical Guidance

### UI Library Configuration

- **Primary UI Library**: shadcn/ui (built on top of Tailwind CSS which is already installed)
- **Why shadcn/ui**: As specified in `docs/tech-stack.md`, it provides "beautifully designed, accessible, and reusable components built on Tailwind CSS"
- **Component Structure**: All shadcn/ui components will be installed in `src/components/ui/` as per the project structure defined in `docs/architecture.md#project-structure`

### State Management

- **Zustand**: Selected as per tech stack for "small, fast, and simple global state management"
- **Store Location**: Will be configured in `src/store/` directory as specified in the project structure

### Routing

- **React Router**: Standard library for client-side navigation
- **Routes Directory**: Page components will be placed in `src/routes/` as defined in the architecture

### Form Management

- **React Hook Form**: Chosen for its performance and ease of use
- **Integration**: Will work seamlessly with shadcn/ui form components

### Path Aliases

- Ensure `@/` path alias is properly configured in both `tsconfig.json` and `vite.config.ts` for clean imports
- This is already set up from story 1.1 but needs verification with shadcn/ui

### CSS Architecture

- Tailwind CSS is already configured from story 1.1
- shadcn/ui will add CSS variables for theming in `src/index.css`
- The application will use utility-first CSS approach with Tailwind

### Development Workflow

- After installation, the development server should continue to work on port 5173
- All new dependencies should be installed as production dependencies (not devDependencies) unless they are build/development tools

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Claude Opus 4`

### Completion Notes List

- All core dependencies successfully installed and configured
