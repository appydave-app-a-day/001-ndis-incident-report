# Story 4.11: Progressive Narrative Consolidation with AI

## Epic
Epic 4: Guided Incident Capture Workflow

## Description
Implement progressive narrative consolidation functionality that uses AI to create supplementary narratives from clarification answers as users complete each clarification step. After completing each phase's clarification questions, the system immediately makes a single API call to consolidate that phase's Q&A responses into enhanced contextual information, building up the complete enhanced incident report progressively rather than waiting until the end.

## User Story
As a frontline worker, I want the system to automatically create enhanced supplementary narratives from my clarification responses as I complete each phase, so that my incident report builds up enhanced content progressively and I don't have to wait at the end for all enhancements to complete.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Progressive Triggering**: After completing each clarification step, the system automatically triggers consolidation for that specific phase
2. **Individual API Calls**: The system makes one API call per phase immediately upon completion of each clarification step
3. **Real-time Enhancement**: Users see their enhanced narratives building up as they progress through the wizard
4. **Supplementary Approach**: Enhanced narratives are stored as supplementary content, preserving original narratives unchanged
5. **Phase-Specific State Management**: Each phase has independent consolidation state (loading, complete, error)
6. **Non-blocking Flow**: Users can proceed to the next step while API calls complete in the background
7. **Individual Error Handling**: Failed consolidations for one phase don't affect other phases
8. **Immediate Feedback**: Each step shows consolidation progress and completion status

## Technical Requirements

### Progressive Data Flow
1. **Step Completion Detection**: Detect when user completes each individual clarification step
2. **Phase-Specific Data Preparation**: Extract clarification answers for the just-completed phase
3. **Individual API Call**: Make single API call to N8N narrative consolidation endpoint for that phase
4. **Background Processing**: API call runs in background, allowing user to proceed to next step
5. **State Updates**: Update phase-specific consolidation state and narrative extra when API call completes
6. **Error Recovery**: Handle individual phase failures without affecting other phases

### Store Integration
```typescript
// New store fields
interface IncidentReport {
  // ... existing fields
  narrativeExtras: {
    beforeEvent: string;
    duringEvent: string;
    endEvent: string;
    postEvent: string;
  };
}

// New store state
interface IncidentState {
  // ... existing state
  consolidationStatus: {
    beforeEvent: 'pending' | 'loading' | 'complete' | 'error';
    duringEvent: 'pending' | 'loading' | 'complete' | 'error';
    endEvent: 'pending' | 'loading' | 'complete' | 'error';
    postEvent: 'pending' | 'loading' | 'complete' | 'error';
  };
  consolidationErrors: {
    beforeEvent?: string;
    duringEvent?: string;
    endEvent?: string;
    postEvent?: string;
  };
}
```

### API Integration
- Use existing `N8NApiService.consolidateNarrative()` method for individual phase calls
- Leverage phase-specific custom instructions from the API config
- Map internal clarification answers to API request format for single phase
- Handle timeouts and network errors appropriately for each phase

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Store Enhancement
- Add `narrativeExtras` field to `IncidentReport` interface
- Add phase-specific consolidation status tracking to `useIncidentStore`
- Create `consolidatePhaseNarrative` action method for individual phases
- Add helper methods to check completion status for each phase

### 2. Progressive Triggering Logic
- Detect completion of each individual clarification step
- Add hook to wizard navigation to trigger consolidation on step completion
- Validate that clarification answers exist for the specific phase
- Automatically trigger consolidation for completed phase

### 3. Data Mapping
- Transform internal clarification answers to API format for single phase
- Map store `ClarificationAnswer[]` to `ClarificationAnswersForConsolidation[]` per phase
- Include question text from clarification questions store for specific phase
- Ensure proper data structure for individual API calls

### 4. API Integration
- Integrate with existing `N8NApiService.consolidateNarrative()` method
- Call API for individual phases rather than batch processing
- Handle phase-specific failures without affecting other phases
- Process API responses and extract `narrative_extra` values per phase

### 5. UI Integration
- Add loading states to each clarification step header/footer
- Display phase-specific consolidation progress indicators
- Show completion status (‚úì) when consolidation succeeds
- Handle error states with retry options per phase

### 6. Error Handling
- Network timeout handling per phase
- Individual phase failure recovery without blocking progression
- User-friendly error messages for specific phases
- Option to retry failed phases independently

## User Experience Flow

### Progressive Happy Path
1. **Step 3**: User completes Before Event clarification questions
   - Click "Next" ‚Üí Before Event consolidation starts (üîÑ 2 seconds)
   - User immediately proceeds to Step 4 while API call completes
   - Header shows "‚úì Before Event enhanced" when complete

2. **Step 4**: User completes During Event clarification questions
   - Click "Next" ‚Üí During Event consolidation starts (üîÑ 2 seconds)
   - User immediately proceeds to Step 5 while API call completes
   - Header shows "‚úì During Event enhanced" when complete

3. **Step 5**: User completes End Event clarification questions
   - Click "Next" ‚Üí End Event consolidation starts (üîÑ 2 seconds)
   - User immediately proceeds to Step 6 while API call completes
   - Header shows "‚úì End Event enhanced" when complete

4. **Step 6**: User completes Post-Event Support clarification questions
   - Click "Next" ‚Üí Post Event consolidation starts (üîÑ 2 seconds)
   - User immediately proceeds to Review step while API call completes
   - Header shows "‚úì Post Event enhanced" when complete

5. **Review Step**: All enhanced narratives are available immediately

### Error Scenarios
1. **Individual Phase Failure**: One phase API call fails
   - Display: "‚ö†Ô∏è Before Event enhancement failed" 
   - Option: "Retry" button next to that specific phase
   - Other phases continue normally

2. **Network Issues**: Timeout on specific phase
   - Display: "üîÑ Before Event enhancement in progress..." (if still loading)
   - Display: "‚ùå Network timeout" (if failed)
   - Option: "Retry" for that specific phase

3. **Background Completion**: API call completes after user moved to next step
   - Subtle notification: "‚úì Before Event enhancement complete"
   - Enhanced narrative becomes available immediately

## Progressive Data Mapping Example

### Single Phase Processing
```typescript
// When user completes Before Event clarification step:

// Input: Store data for Before Event phase only
const beforeEventAnswers = [
  { questionId: 'b1', answer: 'Lisa was sitting quietly watching TV' },
  { questionId: 'b2', answer: 'The room was calm with normal lighting' }
];

const beforeEventQuestions = [
  { id: 'b1', question: 'What was the participant doing before?' },
  { id: 'b2', question: 'What was the environment like?' }
];

// Mapped for single API call
const apiInput = [
  {
    questionId: 'b1',
    question: 'What was the participant doing before?',
    answer: 'Lisa was sitting quietly watching TV'
  },
  {
    questionId: 'b2', 
    question: 'What was the environment like?',
    answer: 'The room was calm with normal lighting'
  }
];

// API Response for this phase
const apiResponse = {
  narrative_extra: 'Additional context: The participant had been in a stable, calm environment for approximately 30 minutes prior to the incident...'
};
```

## Mock Data Enhancement

Update mock service to return realistic enhanced narratives:

```typescript
const mockEnhancedNarratives = {
  beforeEvent: 'Additional context: The participant had been in a stable, calm environment for approximately 30 minutes prior to the incident...',
  duringEvent: 'Additional details: The incident escalated gradually over a 15-20 minute period, with clear behavioral indicators...',
  endEvent: 'Resolution details: The situation was resolved through patient verbal de-escalation and environmental modifications...',
  postEvent: 'Follow-up actions: Comprehensive documentation was completed within 2 hours of the incident...'
};
```
