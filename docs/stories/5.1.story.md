# Story 5.1: Create "Review Full Narrative" & Trigger Analysis

## Story Overview
**Epic:** 5 - AI-Assisted Report Analysis Workflow  
**Story:** 5.1  
**Story Type:** Feature Implementation  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Sprint:** Epic 5, Sprint 1

## User Story
**As a** Team Lead  
**I want** the first step of the analysis workflow to be a read-only view of the complete, enriched narrative from the capture stage  
**So that** I have all the context before I begin my analysis

## Background Context
This story implements the entry point for Epic 5's Team Lead analysis workflow. It builds on Epic 4's successful narrative consolidation by providing a comprehensive review screen and implementing progressive enhancement through asynchronous pre-fetching of analysis data.

The story leverages lessons learned from Epic 4, particularly the progressive enhancement pattern where data is fetched after user interaction rather than blocking the initial UI load.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Criteria
1. **Read-only Narrative Display**
   - The first step of the "Analysis" wizard displays the complete, consolidated narrative in a read-only format
   - Narrative content includes all consolidated sections from the capture workflow
   - Display uses professional styling consistent with the design system

2. **Progressive Analysis Trigger**
   - Upon the user clicking "Next" to leave this step, the application triggers progressive, asynchronous requests using the live/mock switch
   - Two parallel requests are initiated with the full narrative data:
     - Pre-fetch "Contributing Conditions" analysis
     - Pre-fetch "Incident Type Classification" analysis
   - Both requests use the consolidated narrative as input

3. **Non-blocking UI Operations**
   - The prefetch operations do not block the UI
   - User can navigate to the next step immediately
   - Loading indicators show background processing status
   - Handle failures gracefully with appropriate error states

4. **Version Control Commitment**
   - All wizard step components are committed to version control
   - Code follows project conventions and passes linting

### Technical Criteria
- Uses existing wizard framework from Epic 2
- Integrates with analysis state management (extends Epic 4 patterns)
- Implements proper error boundaries and loading states
- Maintains accessibility requirements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

## Technical Implementation Guidance

### 1. Component Structure
```
src/features/analysis/
├── components/
│   ├── ReviewNarrativeStep.tsx     # Main step component
│   ├── NarrativeDisplay.tsx        # Reusable display component
│   └── AnalysisLoadingOverlay.tsx  # Loading state component
├── hooks/
│   └── useAnalysisPrefetch.ts      # Custom hook for prefetch logic
└── types/
    └── analysis.ts                  # TypeScript interfaces
```

### 2. State Management Extension
- Extend existing Zustand store with analysis state
- Implement prefetch status tracking
- Handle background loading states
- Store pre-fetched results for subsequent steps

### 3. API Integration
- Extend existing N8NApiService for analysis endpoints
- Implement mock data scenarios for development
- Use Promise.all for parallel prefetch requests
- Handle timeout and error scenarios gracefully

### 4. Wizard Integration
- Create new wizard step in analysis workflow
- Implement proper navigation between steps
- Handle step validation and progression
- Maintain wizard state consistency

## Definition of Done Checklist
- [ ] Component renders consolidated narrative in read-only format
- [ ] "Next" button triggers asynchronous prefetch operations
- [ ] Prefetch operations run in parallel without blocking UI
- [ ] Loading states are displayed during background operations
- [ ] Error handling is implemented for failed requests
- [ ] Component integrates properly with wizard framework
- [ ] State management stores prefetch results correctly
- [ ] Code passes TypeScript compilation
- [ ] Code passes ESLint validation
- [ ] Component follows accessibility guidelines
- [ ] Testing scenarios cover success and failure cases
- [ ] Mock data scenarios are implemented for development
- [ ] Documentation is updated as needed
- [ ] Code is committed to version control

## Dependencies
- Existing wizard framework (Epic 2)
- Consolidated narrative from capture workflow (Epic 4)
- N8N API service structure (Epic 4)
- Design system components (Epic 3)

## Risk Considerations
- **API Response Time**: Analysis endpoints may be slow; implement proper loading states
- **Network Failures**: Ensure graceful degradation when prefetch fails
- **State Consistency**: Manage prefetch results properly across wizard steps
- **User Experience**: Balance immediate navigation with background processing

## Validation Approach
1. **Manual Testing**
   - Verify read-only narrative display
   - Test "Next" button triggers prefetch
   - Confirm non-blocking UI behavior
   - Validate error handling scenarios

2. **Mock Scenarios**
   - Test with successful analysis responses
   - Test with API timeout scenarios
   - Test with network failure cases
   - Test with empty response data

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Verify wizard navigation works correctly
   - Confirm state persistence across steps
   - Test backward navigation maintains state
   - Validate prefetch results are available in subsequent steps

## Notes for Implementation
- Reuse existing narrative display components from Epic 4 where possible
- Follow Epic 4's progressive enhancement pattern for data fetching
- Maintain consistency with established design system
- Consider implementing retry logic for failed prefetch operations
- Ensure proper cleanup of async operations on component unmount

## Story Completion Criteria
This story is considered complete when:
1. The analysis wizard's first step displays the consolidated narrative
2. Progressive prefetch is triggered on navigation
3. Background operations don't block the user interface
4. Error handling provides appropriate user feedback
5. All code quality standards are met
6. The implementation is committed to version control

The story enables Team Leads to begin their analysis workflow with full context while efficiently preparing the data needed for subsequent analysis steps.
