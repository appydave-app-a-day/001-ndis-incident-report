# Story 2.4: Create Application Shell with Workflow Navigation

## Epic
Epic 2: Core Wizard & Navigation Framework

## Description
Create the main application layout with a left-hand navigation menu that lists the two primary workflows: "1. Incident Capture" and "2. Analysis". The Analysis workflow should be initially disabled, and clicking on Incident Capture should launch the wizard.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Update the Home page to include:
   - Application header with title "NDIS Incident Documentation Assistant"
   - Left-hand navigation sidebar with workflow options
   - Main content area for displaying selected workflows
2. Navigation menu should include:
   - "1. Incident Capture" - clickable, launches the wizard
   - "2. Analysis" - disabled/grayed out initially
   - Visual indication of which workflow is selected
3. Responsive design:
   - Desktop: Persistent sidebar navigation
   - Mobile: Collapsible menu (hamburger icon)
4. Navigation should use React Router for routing
5. Clean, professional design using existing UI components
6. Proper TypeScript typing for all components

## Technical Requirements
- Update the Home component to include the application shell
- Use shadcn/ui components for consistent styling
- Implement responsive navigation using Tailwind CSS
- Use React Router's NavLink for active state styling
- Follow existing code patterns and structure
- Ensure accessibility with proper ARIA labels

## Implementation Notes
- Consider using a layout component that wraps the entire app
- The sidebar should highlight the active workflow
- Use icons to enhance the visual design (if available)
- Ensure smooth transitions between mobile and desktop views
- Test navigation on various screen sizes

## Dependencies
- Previous stories in Epic 2 should be completed
- React Router is already installed and configured
- shadcn/ui components are available
