# Story 4.1: Implement Metadata Input Step

## Epic
Epic 4: Guided Incident Capture Workflow

## Description
Implement the first step of the "Incident Capture" wizard with a form containing input fields for basic incident metadata. This step allows frontline workers to enter essential details about an incident including reporter information, participant details, event timing, and location. The form must be intuitive and clearly labeled for non-technical users.

## User Story
As a frontline worker, I want to enter the basic details of an incident (my name, participant's name, date/time, location) on the first step of the wizard so that the report is correctly categorized.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The first step of the "Incident Capture" wizard presents a form with input fields for:
   - "Reporter Name" (text input)
   - "Participant Name" (text input) 
   - "Event Date/Time" (date and time picker)
   - "Location" (text input)
2. Each input field is clearly labeled with descriptive text
3. The "Event Date/Time" field provides a user-friendly date and time picker interface
4. The values entered by the user in these fields are captured and stored in the application's state when they proceed to the next step
5. Form validation ensures required fields are completed before allowing navigation to next step
6. This new wizard step, including the form components, is committed to version control

## Technical Requirements
- Create an incident data store using Zustand for state management
- Replace the existing placeholder Step1 component in IncidentCapture.tsx with the new metadata form
- Use existing shadcn/ui components (Input, Label) for form fields
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for incident metadata
- Use HTML5 datetime-local input for date/time picker functionality
- Integrate with the existing wizard framework and navigation system

## Implementation Notes
- Follow existing code patterns and styling conventions
- Use the established Tailwind CSS classes for consistent appearance
- Ensure the form is responsive and works on mobile devices
- Store metadata in a dedicated section of the incident state
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing wizard navigation
- Consider accessibility requirements for form labels and input focus

## Dependencies
- Epic 2 (Core Wizard & Navigation Framework) must be completed
- Epic 3 Story 3.1 (Wizard Styling) must be completed
- shadcn/ui Input and Label components must be available

## Definition of Done
- [x] Zustand store created for incident data management with TypeScript interfaces
- [x] Metadata input form component created with all required fields
- [x] Form integrated as Step 1 of the Incident Capture wizard
- [x] User input is properly stored in application state
- [x] Date/time picker provides intuitive user experience
- [x] Form styling matches existing design system
- [x] Component is responsive on mobile and desktop
- [x] Form validation prevents navigation with incomplete required fields
- [x] TypeScript types are properly defined and used
- [x] Code passes ESLint and TypeScript checks
- [x] Manual testing completed for form functionality and state persistence
- [x] Step navigation works correctly with form data storage

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Claude Sonnet 4`

### Completion Notes List
- Created comprehensive Zustand store (`useIncidentStore.ts`) with TypeScript interfaces for IncidentMetadata, IncidentNarrative, and IncidentReport
- Implemented MetadataInputStep component with professional form styling and user-friendly controls
- Enhanced wizard framework to support step validation through optional `isValid` function
- Integrated form validation to prevent navigation with incomplete required fields
- Applied enhanced visual design with rounded cards, proper spacing, and hover effects
- Form includes all required fields: Reporter Name, Participant Name, Event Date/Time (datetime-local input), and Location
- State management automatically updates when form values change
- Form styling follows existing design system with improved typography and spacing

### Change Log
- Added `src/store/useIncidentStore.ts` - Zustand store for incident data management
- Added `src/components/MetadataInputStep.tsx` - Metadata input form component  
- Modified `src/components/wizard/types.ts` - Added optional `isValid` function to WizardStep interface
- Modified `src/components/wizard/Wizard.tsx` - Added validation support with `canProceedNext` function
- Modified `src/routes/IncidentCapture.tsx` - Integrated MetadataInputStep as Step 1 with validation
