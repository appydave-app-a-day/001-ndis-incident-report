# Story 4.9: Refactor Narrative Field Names for API Alignment

## Epic
Epic 4: Guided Incident Capture Workflow

## Description
Refactor the ambiguous narrative field names throughout the application to be more descriptive and align with external API conventions. Replace the overly generic field names (`before`, `during`, `end`) with semantically clear names (`beforeEvent`, `duringEvent`, `endEvent`) to improve code maintainability, API integration, and developer experience. This refactor ensures consistent camelCase naming conventions and prepares the application for seamless external API integration.

## User Story
As a developer working with the incident capture system, I want descriptive and semantically clear field names so that the code is more maintainable, API integration is straightforward, and the data model is self-documenting.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All narrative field names are refactored from generic to descriptive names
2. Field name changes: `before` → `beforeEvent`, `during` → `duringEvent`, `end` → `endEvent`, `postEvent` remains unchanged
3. All TypeScript interfaces are updated with new field names
4. All form components use the new field names consistently
5. All clarification step components use updated field names for phase references
6. Test data and mock data use the new field names
7. API service layer uses the new field names for request mapping
8. All existing functionality continues to work without regression
9. Field references are updated across all affected components and files
10. Code passes ESLint and TypeScript checks with new naming conventions

## Technical Requirements
- Update core TypeScript interfaces in the incident store
- Refactor all form components to use new field names
- Update all clarification step components with new phase references
- Modify test data generation to use new field names
- Update API service layer for proper request/response mapping
- Ensure all field access patterns use new names consistently
- Maintain backwards compatibility during transition if needed
- Preserve all existing functionality and user experience
- Update mock clarification questions data structure
- Ensure proper type safety throughout refactor

## Files Requiring Changes
Based on codebase analysis, the following files require updates:

**Core Data Layer:**
- `src/store/useIncidentStore.ts` - Interface definitions, store logic, test data
- `src/lib/services/api.ts` - Mock data structure, API request mapping

**Form Components:**
- `src/components/NarrativeInputStep.tsx` - Main narrative form field references
- `src/components/BeforeEventClarificationStep.tsx` - Before phase clarification logic
- `src/components/DuringEventClarificationStep.tsx` - During phase clarification logic
- `src/components/EndOfEventClarificationStep.tsx` - End phase clarification logic
- `src/components/PostEventSupportClarificationStep.tsx` - Post phase clarification logic

**Additional Components:**
- Any other components accessing narrative fields directly

## Field Name Mapping
The following field name changes will be implemented:

| Current Name | New Name | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `before` | `beforeEvent` | Descriptive, API-aligned, semantically clear |
| `during` | `duringEvent` | Descriptive, API-aligned, semantically clear |
| `end` | `endEvent` | Descriptive, API-aligned, semantically clear |
| `postEvent` | `postEvent` | Already descriptive and properly named |

## Implementation Notes
- Use systematic find-and-replace approach to ensure all references are updated
- Update TypeScript interfaces first to catch any missed references via type errors
- Test each form component after updates to ensure functionality is preserved
- Update test data to reflect new field names
- Verify API request mapping aligns with external API expectations
- Maintain consistent camelCase convention throughout
- Use TypeScript's compiler to identify any missed references
- Test the complete workflow end-to-end after refactoring

## Dependencies
- Epic 2 (Core Wizard & Navigation Framework) must be completed
- Epic 3 Story 3.1 (Wizard Styling) must be completed  
- Stories 4.1 through 4.8 (All previous Epic 4 stories) must be completed
- All form components must be functional before refactoring
- Test data functionality must be working correctly

## Definition of Done

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Sonnet 4`

### Completion Notes List
- Updated core TypeScript interfaces in `src/store/useIncidentStore.ts` with new field names
- Refactored `NarrativeInputStep.tsx` to use new field names (`beforeEvent`, `duringEvent`, `endEvent`)
- Updated `BeforeEventClarificationStep.tsx` to use `beforeEvent` instead of `before`
- Updated `DuringEventClarificationStep.tsx` to use `duringEvent` instead of `during`
- Updated `EndOfEventClarificationStep.tsx` to use `endEvent` instead of `end`
- PostEventSupportClarificationStep.tsx was already correct (using `postEvent`)
- Updated API service layer mock data and request/response mapping
- Fixed test data generation in the store to use new field names
- Code passes TypeScript compilation and ESLint checks
