# Epic 5, Story 5.5: Branding and Content Refinement

## Story Overview
As a product stakeholder, I want to rebrand the application from "NDIS Incident Report" to "Support Signal" with proper branding, localised content, and refined user experience, so that the application has a professional identity and uses appropriate Australian English throughout.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Application Rebranding
- Replace all references to "NDIS" and "NDIS Incident Report" with "Support Signal" throughout the application
- Update application title in index.html and all navigation components
- Ensure consistent branding across all pages and components

### 2. Logo and Branding Assets
- Add Support Signal logo to the application
  - Place logo files in the `public/` directory
  - Display logo in the sidebar navigation
  - Include logo in the application header where appropriate
- Add tagline beneath or near the logo where space permits
- Ensure logo works in both light and dark modes

### 3. Homepage Summary View
- Transform the current homepage into a summary dashboard view
- Display key metrics or information cards such as:
  - Total incidents reported
  - Incidents pending analysis
  - Recent activity
  - Quick action buttons for common tasks
- Maintain consistent styling with the rest of the application

### 4. Australian English Localisation
- Replace American spelling with Australian English throughout:
  - "analyzing" → "analysing"
  - "organize" → "organise"
  - "center" → "centre"
  - "color" → "colour"
  - Any other American spellings
- Apply to all UI text, button labels, messages, and content

### 5. Loading Screen Text Refinement
- Review all loading messages and remove unnecessary capitalisation
- Ensure consistent sentence case for loading messages
- Examples to fix:
  - "Loading Your Data..." → "Loading your data..."
  - "Preparing Analysis..." → "Preparing analysis..."

### 6. Remove AI References
- Remove or rephrase all references to "AI assistance" throughout the application
- Replace with more neutral terms like:
  - "AI-powered" → "automated"
  - "AI assistance" → "intelligent support" or "automated guidance"
  - "AI analysis" → "automated analysis"
- Maintain the functionality while removing explicit AI mentions
