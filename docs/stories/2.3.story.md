# Story 2.3: Implement Visual Progress Indicator

## Epic
Epic 2: Core Wizard & Navigation Framework

## Description
Add a visual progress indicator at the top of the wizard that shows the total number of steps, highlights the current step, tracks visited steps, and allows navigation by clicking on previously visited steps.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Add a progress bar/indicator at the top of the wizard component
2. The progress indicator should display:
   - All steps with their titles
   - Current step highlighted with a distinct style
   - Visited steps marked differently from unvisited steps
   - Step numbers or icons for each step
3. Navigation functionality:
   - Clicking on a visited step navigates to that step
   - Unvisited steps are not clickable (grayed out)
   - Visual feedback on hover for clickable steps
4. The progress indicator should be responsive:
   - On mobile: Show compact view (step numbers only)
   - On desktop: Show step numbers and titles
5. Smooth transitions when navigating between steps
6. Accessibility considerations:
   - Proper ARIA labels
   - Keyboard navigation support

## Technical Requirements
- Create a new ProgressIndicator component
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design
- Integrate with existing Zustand store
- Ensure TypeScript typing for all components
- Follow existing design patterns

## Implementation Notes
- Consider using CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout
- Use conditional styling based on step state (current, visited, unvisited)
- Add smooth transitions for better UX
- Test with different numbers of steps (2-10 steps)
- Ensure the indicator doesn't break with long step titles

## Dependencies
- Stories 2.1 and 2.2 must be completed
- Wizard component and navigation must be working
