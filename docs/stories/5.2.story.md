# Story 5.2: Review and Edit "Contributing Conditions"

## Story Overview
**Epic:** 5 - AI-Assisted Report Analysis Workflow  
**Story:** 5.2  
**Story Type:** Feature Implementation  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Sprint:** Epic 5, Sprint 1

## User Story
**As a** Team Lead  
**I want** to review the AI-generated summary of contributing conditions and edit it as needed  
**So that** the final analysis is accurate and complete

## Background Context
This story implements the second step of the Epic 5 analysis workflow, building on Story 5.1's narrative review and prefetch functionality. It provides Team Leads with the ability to review and refine AI-generated contributing conditions analysis, ensuring human oversight and customization of automated insights.

The story leverages the prefetched analysis data from Story 5.1 to provide immediate access to AI-generated contributing conditions, while maintaining the progressive enhancement pattern established in Epic 4.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Criteria
1. **Dedicated Analysis Step**
   - The second step of the analysis wizard is dedicated to "Contributing Conditions"
   - Step integrates seamlessly with the existing wizard framework
   - Navigation works correctly to/from this step

2. **Pre-populated Content**
   - Large text area displays the pre-fetched "Immediate Contributing Conditions" text from the AI analysis
   - Content loads from the prefetch data initiated in Story 5.1
   - Handles cases where prefetch data is unavailable with appropriate fallbacks

3. **Editable Interface**
   - User can freely edit, add to, or delete text within the text area
   - Text area provides professional editing experience with proper formatting
   - Real-time character count and validation feedback
   - Supports markdown or rich text formatting for better readability

4. **State Management**
   - Final edited text is saved to application's state when user proceeds to next step
   - Changes are preserved during wizard navigation (backward/forward)
   - Auto-save functionality prevents data loss during editing sessions

5. **Professional UX**
   - Loading states for prefetch data retrieval
   - Error handling when prefetch data is unavailable
   - Clear instructions and guidance for editing
   - Consistent styling with design system

### Technical Criteria
- Integrates with existing wizard framework from Epic 2
- Uses prefetch data from Story 5.1's analysis state
- Implements proper form validation and error handling
- Maintains accessibility requirements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Follows established patterns from Epic 4 implementation

## Technical Implementation Guidance

### 1. Component Structure
```
src/features/analysis/
├── components/
│   ├── ContributingConditionsStep.tsx    # Main step component
│   ├── ConditionsEditor.tsx              # Reusable editor component
│   └── ConditionsLoadingState.tsx        # Loading/error states
├── hooks/
│   ├── useContributingConditions.ts      # Custom hook for conditions logic
│   └── useAutoSave.ts                    # Auto-save functionality
└── types/
    └── contributing-conditions.ts         # TypeScript interfaces
```

### 2. State Management Integration
- Extend analysis Zustand store with contributing conditions state
- Integrate with prefetch results from Story 5.1
- Implement auto-save with debouncing
- Handle editing state and dirty checking
- Store final edited content for subsequent steps

### 3. Editor Implementation
- Use controlled textarea or rich text editor component
- Implement character counting and validation
- Add markdown support for better formatting
- Handle paste operations and text formatting
- Provide editing shortcuts and helpers

### 4. Data Flow
- Retrieve prefetch data from analysis store (Story 5.1)
- Handle missing or incomplete prefetch data
- Implement fallback loading states
- Save edited content to persistent state
- Validate content before step progression

## Definition of Done Checklist
- [ ] Second wizard step renders contributing conditions editor
- [ ] Text area pre-populates with AI-generated content from prefetch
- [ ] User can edit, add, and delete text freely
- [ ] Edited content is saved to application state on navigation
- [ ] Auto-save prevents data loss during editing
- [ ] Loading states handle missing prefetch data gracefully
- [ ] Error handling provides appropriate user feedback
- [ ] Component integrates properly with wizard framework
- [ ] Backward/forward navigation preserves editing state
- [ ] Character count and validation feedback work correctly
- [ ] Code passes TypeScript compilation
- [ ] Code passes ESLint validation
- [ ] Component follows accessibility guidelines
- [ ] Testing scenarios cover editing and state management
- [ ] Mock data scenarios support development workflow
- [ ] Documentation is updated as needed
- [ ] Code is committed to version control

## Dependencies
- Story 5.1's prefetch functionality and analysis state
- Existing wizard framework (Epic 2)
- Analysis state management from Story 5.1
- Design system components (Epic 3)
- Mock data scenarios for contributing conditions

## Risk Considerations
- **Prefetch Failures**: Ensure graceful fallback when AI analysis unavailable
- **Data Loss**: Implement robust auto-save to prevent editing loss
- **Performance**: Large text editing should not impact UI responsiveness
- **State Consistency**: Manage editing state across wizard navigation
- **User Experience**: Balance editing flexibility with guidance

## Validation Approach
1. **Manual Testing**
   - Verify text area pre-populates with AI content
   - Test editing functionality (add, edit, delete text)
   - Confirm state persistence across navigation
   - Validate auto-save and data recovery

2. **Mock Scenarios**
   - Test with successful prefetch data
   - Test with missing/failed prefetch data
   - Test with empty AI response
   - Test with very long contributing conditions text

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Verify wizard navigation maintains editing state
   - Confirm state is available for subsequent steps
   - Test backward navigation preserves changes
   - Validate error recovery and user feedback

## Notes for Implementation
- Reuse existing form components and validation patterns
- Follow Epic 4's state management patterns for consistency
- Implement debounced auto-save to prevent excessive API calls
- Consider implementing markdown preview for better formatting
- Ensure proper cleanup of auto-save timers on component unmount
- Add helpful editing tips and guidance for Team Leads

## Story Completion Criteria
This story is considered complete when:
1. The contributing conditions editor is fully functional
2. AI-generated content pre-populates correctly from prefetch
3. User can edit content with professional editing experience
4. State management preserves changes across navigation
5. Auto-save prevents data loss during editing sessions
6. Error handling provides appropriate fallbacks
7. All code quality standards are met
8. The implementation is committed to version control

The story enables Team Leads to review and refine AI-generated contributing conditions analysis, ensuring human oversight and accuracy in the final incident analysis.
