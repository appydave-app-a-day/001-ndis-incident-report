Epic 3: Wizard Styling & Visual Polish

## Description
Apply comprehensive styling to the wizard component to create a professional, modern appearance with consistent design patterns throughout. This includes establishing a visual hierarchy, color scheme, typography system, and ensuring responsive design across all devices.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Apply Tailwind CSS styling to the wizard container with:
   - Appropriate padding and margins for content breathing room
   - Responsive breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop
   - Subtle shadows or borders to define the wizard boundaries
2. Style the progress indicator with:
   - Enhanced visual design with smooth transitions
   - Clear active, visited, and unvisited state indicators
   - Hover effects for clickable steps
   - Responsive sizing for different screen sizes
3. Implement consistent form element styling:
   - Input fields with clear borders and focus states
   - Consistent label typography and spacing
   - Error state visual indicators
   - Textarea fields with appropriate sizing
4. Navigation button styling:
   - Consistent button design with primary and secondary styles
   - Hover and active states
   - Disabled state styling
   - Proper spacing and alignment
5. Establish typography hierarchy:
   - Heading styles for step titles
   - Body text styles for content
   - Label styles for form fields
   - Consistent font sizes and line heights
6. Color scheme implementation:
   - Primary and secondary colors
   - Neutral colors for backgrounds and borders
   - Semantic colors for success, error, and warning states
   - Ensure WCAG AA compliance for contrast ratios
7. Mobile responsive design:
   - Stack navigation buttons on small screens
   - Adjust spacing and font sizes for mobile
   - Ensure touch-friendly tap targets
8. Optional dark mode support:
   - Basic dark color scheme
   - Toggle mechanism (if time permits)

## Technical Requirements
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling
- Follow existing component patterns and conventions
- Ensure styles work with shadcn/ui components
- Use CSS custom properties for theme values where appropriate
- Test on multiple screen sizes and devices

## Implementation Notes
- Consider creating utility classes for commonly used style combinations
- Use Tailwind's @apply directive sparingly for complex component styles
- Ensure smooth transitions for interactive elements
- Test with keyboard navigation to ensure focus states are visible
- Consider using Tailwind's prose classes for content areas

- Stories 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 must be completed (wizard component with navigation and progress indicator)
