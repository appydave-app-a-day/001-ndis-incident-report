# Story 4.10: Implement N8N API Integration Foundation

## Epic
Epic 4: Guided Incident Capture Workflow

## Description
Establish a comprehensive API integration foundation for N8N workflows that supports both clarification question retrieval and narrative consolidation. This story creates the service layer architecture, TypeScript interfaces, configuration management, and complete documentation for integrating with N8N webhook endpoints, while maintaining mock data functionality for development.

## User Story
As a developer integrating with N8N workflows, I want a complete API service foundation with proper configuration, error handling, and documentation so that I can seamlessly switch between mock and live API modes and have clear contracts for backend workflow development.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **API Service Architecture**
   - Configurable domain via environment variables
   - Two distinct API endpoints with proper TypeScript interfaces
   - Mock mode functionality for development
   - Comprehensive error handling and response typing

2. **Clarification Questions API**
   - Endpoint: `POST /webhook/narrative-report-clarification`
   - Proper request/response typing
   - Integration with existing wizard workflow

3. **Narrative Consolidation API**
   - Endpoint: `POST /webhook/narrative-consolidation`
   - Support for phase-specific custom instructions
   - Four separate API calls (one per phase)

4. **Configuration Management**
   - Environment variable for domain configuration
   - Hardcoded workflow endpoint names
   - Easy mock/live mode switching

5. **Documentation**
   - Complete API contracts with examples
   - curl request examples for testing
   - N8N workflow setup instructions for backend developers
   - LLM prompts in N8N interpolation format

6. **Development Support**
   - Mock data continues to work seamlessly
   - Service classes implemented but remain in mock mode
   - Easy testing and development workflow

## Technical Requirements

### Environment Configuration
```typescript
// .env
VITE_N8N_DOMAIN=buildergeniobit.app.n8n.cloud
VITE_API_MODE=mock // or 'live'
```

### API Endpoints
1. **Clarification Questions**: `POST https://{domain}/webhook/narrative-report-clarification`
2. **Narrative Consolidation**: `POST https://{domain}/webhook/narrative-consolidation`

### Service Architecture
```typescript
interface N8NApiConfig {
  domain: string;
  mode: 'mock' | 'live';
  endpoints: {
    clarificationQuestions: 'narrative-report-clarification';
    narrativeConsolidation: 'narrative-consolidation';
  };

    "post_event_support": "Lisa returned home the next day"
  }'
```

### 2. Narrative Consolidation API

#### Request Structure

interface NarrativeConsolidationRequest {
  clarification_questions: Array<{
    question: string;
    answer: string;
  }>;
  custom_instructions: string;
}
```

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "clarification_questions": [
      {
        "question": "What was the participant doing before the incident?",
        "answer": "Lisa was sitting quietly on the couch watching afternoon TV"
      },
      {
        "question": "What was the environment like?",
        "answer": "Living room was calm with normal lighting, no other people present"
      }
    ],
    "custom_instructions": "Focus on environmental factors and participant baseline state"
  }'
```

## LLM Prompts (N8N Interpolation Format)

### Clarification Questions Prompt
```
You are an NDIS incident reporting assistant. Generate relevant clarification questions for each phase of the incident.

**INCIDENT DETAILS:**
Participant: {{ $json.participant_name }}
Reporter: {{ $json.reporter_name }}
Location: {{ $json.location }}

**BEFORE EVENT:** {{ $json.before_event }}
**DURING EVENT:** {{ $json.during_event }}
**END OF EVENT:** {{ $json.end_of_event }}
**POST EVENT:** {{ $json.post_event_support }}

Generate 3-5 relevant clarification questions for each phase that would help provide additional context and detail for the incident report.

**RESPONSE FORMAT:**
Return as JSON with arrays for each phase:
{
  "before_event_questions": ["question1", "question2", ...],
  "during_event_questions": ["question1", "question2", ...],
  "end_of_event_questions": ["question1", "question2", ...],
  "post_event_questions": ["question1", "question2", ...]
}
```

### Narrative Consolidation Prompt
```
You are a professional NDIS incident report writer. Consolidate clarification responses into a supplementary narrative.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
{{ $json.custom_instructions }}

**CLARIFICATION RESPONSES:**
{{#each $json.clarification_questions}}
Q: {{ this.question }}
A: {{ this.answer }}
{{/each}}

**TASK:** Create a supplementary narrative that consolidates these clarification responses into additional contextual information.

**RESPONSE:** Return only the consolidated narrative text as a JSON object:
{
  "narrative_extra": "your consolidated narrative here"
}
```
