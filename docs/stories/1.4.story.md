# Story 1.4: Configure Linter and Formatter

## Status: Complete

## Story

- As a developer
- I want to set up and configure ESLint and Prettier
- so that a consistent code style is enforced across the entire project from the beginning.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. ESLint and Prettier packages, along with any necessary plugins, are installed as development dependencies.
2. Configuration files (e.g., `.eslintrc.json`, `.prettierrc`) are created in the project root.
3. Scripts to run the linter and formatter are added to `package.json` (e.g., `lint`, `format`).
4. Running the `format` script on the initial project codebase completes successfully.
5. Running the `lint` script on the initial project codebase passes without any errors.
6. All new configuration files and changes to `package.json` are committed to version control.

  - [x] Add or update `lint:fix` script to auto-fix linting issues
  - [x] Add `format` script to run Prettier on the codebase
  - [x] Add `format:check` script to check if files are formatted correctly

  - [x] Run `npm run format` on the entire codebase
  - [x] Run `npm run lint` and ensure it passes without errors
  - [x] Test linting on individual files to ensure rules are working
  - [x] Verify that IDE integration works properly (if applicable)

- [x] Task 7: Commit configuration changes (AC: 6)
  - [x] Stage all new configuration files and package.json changes
  - [x] Create a commit with message: "feat: Configure ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style"
  - [x] Verify all changes are properly committed

## Dev Technical Guidance

### ESLint Configuration

- **Base Configuration**: Use `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and `@typescript-eslint/parser` for TypeScript support
- **React Rules**: Include `eslint-plugin-react` and `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` for React-specific linting
- **Accessibility**: Use `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` for accessibility compliance
- **Import Rules**: Use `eslint-plugin-import` for consistent import/export practices
- **Tailwind Integration**: Consider `eslint-plugin-tailwindcss` for Tailwind CSS class ordering

### Prettier Configuration

- **Integration**: Ensure Prettier doesn't conflict with ESLint using `eslint-config-prettier`
- **Style Preferences**: Configure based on project conventions (e.g., single quotes, semicolons, trailing commas)
- **File Types**: Configure for TypeScript, JavaScript, JSX, CSS, and Markdown files

### Script Configuration

The following scripts should be added to `package.json`:

- `lint`: Run ESLint on source files
- `lint:fix`: Run ESLint with auto-fix enabled
- `format`: Format all files with Prettier
- `format:check`: Check if files are properly formatted

### Integration Considerations

- Ensure configuration works with Vite build process
- Verify compatibility with existing shadcn/ui components
- Consider IDE integration (VS Code settings, if applicable)
- Ensure configuration doesn't conflict with existing build tools

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Claude Sonnet 4`

### Completion Notes List

- ESLint was already partially configured from previous stories but needed additional plugins
- Successfully installed Prettier, eslint-config-prettier, eslint-plugin-prettier, eslint-plugin-react, eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y, eslint-plugin-import, and eslint-import-resolver-typescript
- Updated ESLint configuration with comprehensive rules for React, TypeScript, accessibility, and import organization
- Created .prettierrc with consistent formatting preferences (single quotes, semicolons, trailing commas)
- Added .prettierignore to exclude build artifacts and dependencies
- Updated package.json with lint, lint:fix, format, and format:check scripts
- ESLint passes with only 1 minor warning about shadcn/ui button component (acceptable)
- Prettier successfully formatted all files in the codebase
- Build process works without errors

### Change Log

- 2025-01-11: Story completed - ESLint and Prettier configured successfully

## Story Completion Summary

This story successfully configured ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style enforcement across the project. ESLint was enhanced with comprehensive plugins for React, TypeScript, accessibility (jsx-a11y), and import organization. Prettier was configured with project-appropriate formatting rules and proper integration with ESLint to avoid conflicts. The configuration includes automated formatting and linting scripts, with the ability to auto-fix most common issues. The setup ensures code quality and consistency for all future development work.
