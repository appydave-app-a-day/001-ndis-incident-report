# Story 2.1: Create Reusable Wizard Component Shell

## Epic
Epic 2: Core Wizard & Navigation Framework

## Description
Create a generic, reusable wizard component that can accept an array of steps and manage navigation between them. This component will serve as the foundation for both the incident capture and analysis workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create a `Wizard.tsx` component in `/src/components/wizard/`
2. The wizard accepts an array of steps with the following structure:
   - `id: string` - Unique identifier for the step
   - `title: string` - Display title for the step
   - `component: React.ComponentType` - The component to render for this step
3. Implement state management using Zustand to track:
   - Current step index
   - Total number of steps
   - Step history (visited steps)
4. Display the content of the active step
5. The wizard should be responsive and work on mobile devices
6. Include TypeScript types for all props and state

## Technical Requirements
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement using React functional components with hooks
- Use Zustand for state management
- Follow the existing project structure and coding standards
- Ensure the component is reusable and not coupled to specific workflows

## Implementation Notes
- The wizard component should be agnostic to the content of each step
- Step components will be passed as props and rendered dynamically
- Consider using React.memo for performance optimization
- The component should handle edge cases like empty steps array

## Dependencies
- This story depends on the project foundation from Epic 1
- Required packages are already installed (React, TypeScript, Zustand)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Wizard component created with TypeScript
- [ ] Zustand store created for wizard state management
- [ ] Component accepts and renders steps dynamically
- [ ] Current step content is displayed correctly
- [ ] Code follows ESLint and Prettier configurations
- [ ] Component is exported from index file for easy importing
- [ ] Basic unit tests are written for the component
- [ ] Component works on desktop and mobile viewports
