# Story 1.3: Establish Directory Structure

## Status: Pending

## Story

- As a developer
- I want to create the primary top-level directory structure (e.g., `src/components`, `src/features`, `src/lib`) 
- so that all future code can be organized consistently

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The following directories are created within the application's `src` folder: `/components`, `/features`, `/lib`, `/hooks`, `/store`, and `/types`.
2. Each newly created directory contains a basic `README.md` file that briefly explains the directory's purpose (e.g., "This directory holds reusable React components.").
3. The application continues to compile and run without errors after the new directories are added.
4. The new empty directories and their `README.md` files are committed to version control.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Analyze current project structure (AC: 1, 3)
    - [ ] Review existing `src/` directory structure
    - [ ] Identify which directories already exist vs need to be created
    - [ ] Verify current application builds and runs successfully

- [ ] Task 2: Create missing directory structure (AC: 1)
    - [ ] Create `src/components/` directory (if not exists)
    - [ ] Create `src/features/` directory (if not exists)
    - [ ] Create `src/lib/` directory (if not exists)
    - [ ] Create `src/hooks/` directory (if not exists)
    - [ ] Create `src/store/` directory (if not exists)
    - [ ] Create `src/types/` directory (if not exists)

- [ ] Task 3: Create README.md files for each directory (AC: 2)
    - [ ] Create `src/components/README.md` with purpose explanation
    - [ ] Create `src/features/README.md` with purpose explanation
    - [ ] Create `src/lib/README.md` with purpose explanation
    - [ ] Create `src/hooks/README.md` with purpose explanation
    - [ ] Create `src/store/README.md` with purpose explanation
    - [ ] Create `src/types/README.md` with purpose explanation

- [ ] Task 4: Verify application functionality (AC: 3)
    - [ ] Run `npm run dev` to ensure development server starts without errors
    - [ ] Run `npm run build` to verify production build works
    - [ ] Run `npm run lint` to ensure no linting errors are introduced
    - [ ] Test that the application renders correctly with new directory structure

- [ ] Task 5: Commit changes to version control (AC: 4)
    - [ ] Stage all new directories and README.md files
    - [ ] Create a commit with message: "feat: Establish primary directory structure with documentation"
    - [ ] Verify all changes are properly committed

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Directory Structure Purpose

Based on the project architecture defined in `docs/architecture.md`, each directory serves a specific purpose:

- **`src/components/`**: Houses reusable React components that can be used across different features
  - Should include both UI components and layout components
  - Components here should be feature-agnostic and reusable

- **`src/features/`**: Contains feature-specific modules organized by business domain
  - Each feature should be self-contained with its own components, hooks, and utilities
  - Examples: `incident-capture/`, `incident-analysis/`, `reporting/`

- **`src/lib/`**: Utility functions, services, and third-party integrations
  - API clients, data transformation utilities, constants
  - Should not contain React-specific code

- **`src/hooks/`**: Custom React hooks that can be shared across components
  - State management hooks, API hooks, utility hooks
  - Should follow React hooks naming convention (useXxx)

- **`src/store/`**: Global state management using Zustand
  - Store slices, actions, and selectors
  - Should be organized by domain/feature

- **`src/types/`**: TypeScript type definitions and interfaces
  - Shared types across the application
  - API response types, domain models, utility types

### File Organization Best Practices

- Use `index.ts` files for clean imports where appropriate
- Group related files within subdirectories
- Follow consistent naming conventions (kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components)
- Keep feature-specific code within the `features/` directory
- Place truly reusable components in the `components/` directory

### Integration with Existing Structure

The project already has some directories in place:
- `src/components/ui/` (from shadcn/ui setup)
- Potentially other directories from previous stories

Ensure new directories complement the existing structure without conflicts.
