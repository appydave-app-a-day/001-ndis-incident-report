# Story 4.3: Implement "Before Event" Clarification Step

## Epic
Epic 4: Guided Incident Capture Workflow

## Description
Implement the third step of the "Incident Capture" wizard featuring a clarification interface for the "Before the Event" narrative phase. This step presents pre-fetched clarifying questions specifically related to the user's "Before the Event" narrative input, allowing frontline workers to provide additional context and details through optional answers. The interface maintains the professional design established in previous steps while providing an intuitive question-and-answer format.

## User Story
As a frontline worker, I want to be presented with a list of clarifying questions specifically about the "Before the Event" narrative I provided, with the ability to provide optional answers.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The third step of the "Incident Capture" wizard is dedicated to "Before the Event" clarifications
2. The system displays the list of pre-fetched questions that are relevant to the "Before the Event" phase from the clarification questions store
3. Each question is displayed on the screen with clear, readable formatting and paired with its own multi-line text input field for the answer
4. Questions are presented in a logical, easy-to-scan layout with proper spacing and visual hierarchy
5. The user can navigate to the next step without entering text into any of the answer fields (i.e., answering is optional)
6. Any answers provided are captured and stored in the application's state, associated with their respective questions
7. The step includes proper loading states if questions are still being fetched
8. Error handling displays appropriate messaging if no questions are available
9. Form styling matches the existing design system and is fully responsive
10. Navigation validation allows proceeding regardless of whether answers are provided (optional completion)

## Technical Requirements
- Create a BeforeEventClarificationStep component as the third step in the IncidentCapture wizard
- Extend the IncidentStore to support storing clarification answers with question-answer associations
- Use shadcn/ui Textarea components for answer input fields with consistent styling
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for clarification answers
- Integrate with the existing wizard framework and navigation system
- Handle cases where clarification questions may not be loaded yet
- Ensure responsive design across mobile and desktop devices
- Maintain state persistence when navigating between wizard steps

## Implementation Notes
- Follow the established patterns from MetadataInputStep and NarrativeInputStep for consistency
- Use the existing StepHeader component for the step title and description
- Questions should be displayed in the order they were fetched from the API
- Text areas should be appropriately sized for detailed responses (similar to narrative step)
- Consider UX for scenarios where many questions are present (scrolling, grouping)
- Store answers in a structured format that associates each answer with its question ID
- Implement proper error boundaries for graceful handling of missing questions
- Follow existing form styling patterns with proper labels and spacing

## Dependencies
- Epic 2 (Core Wizard & Navigation Framework) must be completed
- Epic 3 Story 3.1 (Wizard Styling) must be completed  
- Story 4.1 (Metadata Input Step) must be completed
- Story 4.2 (Multi-Section Narrative Input Step & Pre-fetch Clarifications) must be completed
- Clarification questions must be available in the incident store from the previous step
- shadcn/ui Textarea and Label components must be available

## Definition of Done

- [x] Navigation allows proceeding without answering questions (optional completion)
- [x] Loading states displayed when questions are not yet available
- [x] Error handling implemented for missing or failed question loading
- [x] Component styling matches existing design system and is responsive
- [x] Step validation integrates correctly with wizard navigation framework
- [x] TypeScript types are properly defined and used throughout
- [x] Code passes ESLint and TypeScript checks
- [x] Manual testing completed for question display, answer persistence, and navigation
- [x] Cross-browser and mobile testing completed
- [x] Edge cases tested (no questions, loading states, navigation behavior)

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Claude Sonnet 4`

### Completion Notes List

- Questions are displayed with clear numbering and readable formatting
- Each question paired with appropriately sized multi-line text area for detailed responses
- Real-time state updates as users type answers, with immediate persistence to store
- Answers are optional - users can proceed without completing any questions
- Loading state shows spinner with descriptive message during question fetching
- No questions state provides helpful guidance with option to proceed
- Integrated component as Step 3 in wizard with updated step titles and navigation
- Component follows existing design patterns and styling consistency
- Fully responsive layout works across mobile and desktop devices
- Proper error handling for edge cases and graceful degradation
