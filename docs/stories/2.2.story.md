# Story 2.2: Implement Wizard Navigation Controls

## Epic
Epic 2: Core Wizard & Navigation Framework

## Description
Add navigation controls (Next and Back buttons) to the wizard component. The Back button should be disabled on the first step, and the Next button should change to "Finish" on the last step.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Add a navigation bar at the bottom of the wizard with Back and Next buttons
2. Back button functionality:
   - Disabled on the first step
   - When clicked, navigates to the previous step
   - Only navigates to previously visited steps
3. Next button functionality:
   - When clicked, navigates to the next step
   - Changes text to "Finish" on the last step
   - When "Finish" is clicked, calls the onComplete callback if provided
4. Navigation buttons should be styled consistently with the application theme
5. Navigation should update the Zustand store state correctly
6. Keyboard navigation support (optional enhancement):
   - Arrow keys for navigation
   - Enter key for Next/Finish

## Technical Requirements
- Use shadcn/ui Button components for consistency
- Implement navigation logic in the Wizard component
- Update the useWizardStore to handle navigation actions
- Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all new functionality
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions

## Implementation Notes
- Consider using CSS flexbox or grid for button layout
- Ensure buttons have proper focus states for accessibility
- Test edge cases like single-step wizards
- Navigation should feel smooth and responsive

## Dependencies
- Story 2.1 must be completed (Wizard component shell)
- shadcn/ui Button component should be available
