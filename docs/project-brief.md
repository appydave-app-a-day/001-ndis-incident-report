# Project Brief: NDIS Incident Documentation Assistant

## 1\. Introduction / Problem Statement

NDIS (National Disability Insurance Scheme) service providers currently rely on a variety of bespoke and inconsistent methods for incident reporting, ranging from simple Slack messages and Excel spreadsheets to pen and paper. This ad-hoc approach presents a significant challenge. The primary reporters are frontline support workers who have just experienced the incident firsthand. While they are the best source of information, it is not their primary job to write detailed reports, and the quality of their initial write-ups can vary significantly.

The core problem is the lack of a structured, user-friendly system that can not only capture the support worker's immediate account of an incident but also intelligently question them to enrich the narrative with crucial details. This entire process should happen within a couple of hours of the incident to ensure accuracy. The absence of such a tool leads to inconsistent data, missed opportunities for analysis, and difficulty in identifying systemic issues or areas for improving participant care.

## 2\. Vision & Goals

  * **Vision:** To become the industry-standard SaaS solution for NDIS incident reporting, transforming it from an inconsistent administrative burden into a streamlined, data-rich process. By providing a superior reporting experience, we will empower service providers to uncover systemic issues, improve participant care, and create more efficient internal systems.

  * **Primary Goals (for this MVP):**

    1.  Develop a compelling, high-fidelity MVP to demonstrate the core value proposition to potential NDIS service provider clients.
    2.  Validate the hypothesis that a guided, question-based workflow can produce significantly higher-quality incident reports compared to traditional methods.
    3.  Create a seamless user experience for the frontline worker that allows them to complete a detailed report and preliminary analysis within two hours of an incident.

  * **Success Metrics (Initial Ideas):**

      * **Reporting Quality:** The final reports generated by the tool should be demonstrably more detailed and useful than those from existing methods, with the goal of being multiple times better.
      * **AI-Ready Data:** The structured output (JSON/Markdown) must be sufficiently rich and accurate to serve as a high-quality input for a future AI analysis database.
      * **Efficiency Gains:** The process should clearly demonstrate a potential reduction in the hours required for manual analysis of each incident by management.
      * **Client Interest:** Positive feedback and expressions of interest from potential clients during demonstrations will be a key indicator of success for the MVP.

## 3\. Target Audience / Users

**Primary User (Incident Reporter)**

The primary user of this application is the **frontline NDIS support worker**. This individual has just personally experienced and been involved in a reportable incident. Their key characteristics are:

  * They possess the most immediate and direct knowledge of the incident's events.
  * They are not professional report writers; their primary role is providing care and support.
  * They are likely under time pressure and need to complete the report within a couple of hours of the incident occurring, while the details are still fresh.

The system must be designed with their needs in mind: simple, intuitive, and guided, to help them produce a high-quality report without requiring specialized writing skills.

**Secondary User (Basic Analysis)**

A Team Leader, Service Manager, or internal Business Consultant. This user reviews the captured narrative to perform an initial analysis, identify contributing factors, and add preliminary recommendations, creating a more complete report for management or compliance.

## 4\. Key Features / Scope (High-Level Ideas for MVP)

The MVP will be a front-end application operating with an in-memory or local file-based system; it will not require a backend database or user authentication. Its scope is focused on demonstrating the following two-part workflow:

**Workflow 1: Guided Incident Capture**

  * A step-by-step wizard interface to guide the frontline worker through the reporting process.
  * Capture basic incident metadata (`reporter_name`, `participant_name`, `event_datetime`, `location`).
  * Collect separate narratives for the four key phases of the incident: before, during, end, and post-event support.
  * After the initial narrative is captured, the system will present clarifying, follow-up questions for each of the four sections to enrich the report with more detail.
  * Display a final, consolidated narrative that combines the original input with the additional context for the user's review.

**Workflow 2: Basic Analysis**

  * Allow a secondary user (Team Leader/Manager) to review the final narrative from Workflow 1.
  * Provide a mechanism for the secondary user to identify and record immediate "Contributing Conditions" or systemic gaps based on the narrative.
  * Provide a mechanism for the secondary user to classify the incident according to a predefined list of NDIS incident categories.

**Core Application Functionality**

  * The ability to export the complete report (including the enriched narrative and the basic analysis) into both **Markdown** and **JSON** formats by copying the content **directly to the clipboard**.

## 5\. Post MVP Features / Scope and Ideas

The following features and capabilities are explicitly out of scope for the current MVP but are recorded here as potential future enhancements for a full-fledged SaaS product:

  * **Full SaaS Platform:** Development of a multi-tenant SaaS application with user accounts, authentication, and role-based access control.
  * **Persistent Backend & Database:** Implementation of a robust backend and a persistent database to securely store and manage all incident reports over time.
  * **Production-Grade Security & Compliance:** Implementing production-level security, data privacy controls, and audit trails to comply with Australian privacy laws and NDIS requirements.
  * **Official NDIS API Integration:** Direct API synchronization with official NDIS systems for automated reporting.
  * **Advanced AI Analysis:** Moving beyond basic analysis to a full AI-driven system that performs trend analysis across all incidents, identifies systemic risks, and provides predictive insights for client care improvements.
  * **Management Dashboards:** A dedicated interface for managers to view, filter, and analyze multiple incident reports for their teams or the entire organization.
  * **PDF Export:** Adding functionality to export reports as formatted PDF documents.

## 6\. Known Technical Constraints or Preferences

  * **Constraints:**

      * The application is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for demonstration purposes only and does not require production-grade infrastructure.
      * The system must operate as a front-end-only application without a dedicated backend or persistent database; an in-memory or local browser storage solution is sufficient.

  * **Initial Architectural Preferences:**

      * The application should be built as a simple React app.
      * The UI should utilize a component library that makes it easy to create a polished, professional look, with initial suggestions being Tailwind CSS or shadcn/ui.

  * **Risks:**

      * The specifics of the N8N workflow to call a Large Language Model for generating clarifying questions are currently unknown. The viability and quality of this simulated real-time interaction are a key risk to the effectiveness of the demo and must be validated.
