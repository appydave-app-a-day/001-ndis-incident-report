Your task
Identify and summarise the immediate contributing conditions â€” any meaningful patterns, responses, support gaps, or participant behaviours that contributed to the occurrence or escalation of this specific incident.

These may include:
- Known behaviour patterns or risks that were triggered
- Gaps in communication, coordination, or support
- Unclear roles or delayed responses
- Environmental or emotional triggers
- Process failures or ineffective de-escalation
- Misaligned support strategies
- Use only the information provided. Do not make assumptions or speculate. Focus on what can be reasonably supported by the report.

Response Format
Return your findings a code block in the following format:

\`\`\`
**Immediate Contributing Conditions**

### [Condition Name 1]
- [Specific supporting detail from the report]
- [Another relevant observation]

### [Condition Name 2]
- [Specific supporting detail]
\`\`\`

Only include items clearly supported by the data.
ðŸš« Do not include conditions if there's no evidence they occurred.
ðŸ§­ Focus on immediate relevance to this incident â€” not long-term systemic causes.`.trim();
