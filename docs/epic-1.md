### Epic 1: Project Foundation & Initial Setup

- **Goal:** To establish the foundational structure of the React application, including project scaffolding, dependency installation, and basic file structure, to support all future development.

#### Stories:

- **Story 1.1: Initial Application Scaffolding**

  - **User Story:** As a developer, I want to create the initial React application using a standard scaffolding tool (e.g., Vite) so that we have a basic, runnable starting point for the project.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  A new React project is successfully created in the project's monorepo.
    2.  Running the standard `dev` command (e.g., `npm run dev`) successfully starts the local development server without errors.
    3.  The default application starter page is accessible and renders correctly in a web browser.
    4.  The initial project files are successfully committed to the main branch of the version control system.

- **Story 1.2: Install Core Dependencies**

  - **User Story:** As a developer, I want to install and configure the core project dependencies, including the chosen UI library (e.g., Tailwind CSS or shadcn/ui), so that foundational tools are available for all subsequent development.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The chosen UI library (e.g., Tailwind CSS or shadcn/ui) is successfully installed.
    2.  The necessary configuration files for the UI library (e.g., `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`) are created and correctly configured.
    3.  The application's main stylesheet is updated to include the necessary directives for the UI library.
    4.  The application successfully compiles and runs with the new dependencies installed.
    5.  All changes, including updates to `package.json` (and lock files) and new configuration files, are committed to version control.

- **Story 1.3: Establish Directory Structure**

  - **User Story:** As a developer, I want to create the primary top-level directory structure (e.g., `src/components`, `src/features`, `src/lib`) so that all future code can be organized consistently.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The following directories are created within the application's `src` folder: `/components`, `/features`, `/lib`, `/hooks`, `/store`, and `/types`.
    2.  Each newly created directory contains a basic `README.md` file that briefly explains the directory's purpose (e.g., "This directory holds reusable React components.").
    3.  The application continues to compile and run without errors after the new directories are added.
    4.  The new empty directories and their `README.md` files are committed to version control.

- **Story 1.4: Configure Linter and Formatter**
  - **User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up and configure ESLint and Prettier so that a consistent code style is enforced across the entire project from the beginning.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  ESLint and Prettier packages, along with any necessary plugins, are installed as development dependencies.
    2.  Configuration files (e.g., `.eslintrc.json`, `.prettierrc`) are created in the project root.
    3.  Scripts to run the linter and formatter are added to `package.json` (e.g., `lint`, `format`).
    4.  Running the `format` script on the initial project codebase completes successfully.
    5.  Running the `lint` script on the initial project codebase passes without any errors.
    6.  All new configuration files and changes to `package.json` are committed to version control.
