# Library

This directory contains utility functions, services, and third-party integrations.

## Structure

- `services/` - API clients and external service integrations
- `mock-data/` - Mock data for development and testing
- `utils.ts` - General utility functions and helpers

Code in this directory should not contain React-specific functionality - use the `hooks/` directory for React-related utilities.
