# Types

This directory contains TypeScript type definitions and interfaces shared across the application.

## Purpose

Include:

- API response types
- Domain models and business entities
- Utility types and generic interfaces
- Shared enums and constants

Types should be well-organized and follow consistent naming conventions for maintainability.
