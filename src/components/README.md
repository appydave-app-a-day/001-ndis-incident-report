# Components

This directory holds reusable React components that can be used across different features.

## Structure

- `ui/` - shadcn/ui components (button, card, input, etc.)
- `layout/` - Layout components (headers, footers, navigation, etc.)

Components in this directory should be feature-agnostic and reusable across the entire application.
