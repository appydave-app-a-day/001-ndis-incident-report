# Features

This directory contains feature-specific modules organized by business domain.

## Structure

Each feature should be self-contained with its own components, hooks, and utilities:

- `incident-capture/` - Components and logic for capturing incident reports
- `incident-analysis/` - Components and logic for analyzing incidents

Each feature directory should follow a consistent internal structure for maintainability.
