# Hooks

This directory contains custom React hooks that can be shared across components.

## Purpose

Custom hooks should follow React hooks naming convention (useXxx) and include:

- State management hooks
- API hooks for data fetching
- Utility hooks for common React patterns
- Feature-specific hooks that can be reused

All hooks should be tested and well-documented for reusability.
